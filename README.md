Substitution Manager User Manual

Introduction
The purpose of this application is to track the number of minutes a player is in a basketball game. This is important for youth sports where players receiving equal playing time is important. Substitution Manager will also display how many minutes each player should play based on the total game time and the size of the roster.

Before the Game Starts
When you start the application, you are met with a welcome screen. Select Start Game to go to the next screen. You will then be able to choose to Create a New Roster or Select a Saved Roster. There are three default rosters already available. If you create a new roster, you will be able to input up to 15 players. Note the first 5 players on the roster are default starters. Otherwise, you can select one of the saved rosters. Once you select a roster, you will have to enter the Number of Quarters and the Quarter Length. Now you are ready for the game to start. The players in teal are currently in the game while the rest are on the bench.

Making a Substitution
When you are ready to make a substitution, click Make Substitution. You will be asked to enter the current quarter and time shown on the scoreboard. Then you can see the five players on the court and how many minutes they have played. Select one and the player you are subbing in. You can then sub another player in/out or click cancel to return to the game screen.

Ending the Game
At any point you can select End Game to be taken back to the start screen to start a new game.
